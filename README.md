This project introduces an intelligent speech training assistant designed to enhance public speaking skills through three comprehensive evaluation rounds:

Rapid Fire (Round 1): Users complete analogies within 5 seconds, testing quick thinking and articulation.

Triple Step (Round 2): Participants deliver a 5-minute speech on a random topic, evaluated for coherence, relevance, and fluency.

Conductor (Round 3): A novel emotion-based exercise where users select sentences from a dropdown menu and deliver them in specified emotions (e.g., angry, joyful etc..).
